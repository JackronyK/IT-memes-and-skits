# 🎭 Techie Tings – IT Memes, Skits & Digital Madness 🤓💻

Welcome to **Techie Tings**, the only GitHub repo where code meets comedy, bytes bite back, and RAM might just be a *kondoo dume* 🐏🔥

## 💡 What is this?

This is a mini blog/site that blends **technology** with **humor** to create:
- 🎬 **Skits & Scripts** (like “CS ICT and the Case of the Missing RAM”)
- 😂 **IT Memes** for developers, sysadmins, tech bros & sisters
- 🤖 Funny takes on serious tech concepts like cloud, AI, Git, Python, and more
- 🌍 Kenyan-flavored digital comedy with a pinch of Gîkûyû spice 🌶️

## 📚 Why?

Because sometimes, tech is too serious.  
And sometimes… it's just funnier when your boss thinks **Python** is a snake 🐍 or **1TB** is a disease 😷.
